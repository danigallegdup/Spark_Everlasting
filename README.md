# Spark_Everlasting

A WebGL project capturing the unchanging spark of a ballerina through time.

## ballerina is hierarchical object

hierarchical object of at least three levels in the hierarchy  (e.g. human arm body -> shoulder -> elbow ...) where joint motion clearly shows the interaction between levels. A good example of this is the legs in A1, note that legs in A2 will not count (you can not simply use the legs to fulfill this requirement)
