# Spark_Everlasting

plan of attack code quality
1. create Supporting js file for every feature so that main.js is a managable size
2. work on fitting the requirements, finetunning in a seperate copy before integrating it into the main A2 version
3. Creativity (artistic storytelling & object details) --> Know the exact realisitic easy to implement and fit requirements while being interesting and details
4. Scene complexity (design, movement, programming)	ðŸš§ In Progress -- ballerina split jump priottee with spotting head,and al pase legs, what us possible realisitice -- I want to make something that fit the requirements and looks ok fast and that I can fine tune to make it better but get it to a 70% quickly
5. add imported js files instead of more classes in the  huge main.js

Need First: help me create the most basic nothing to do wiht this assignmetn WebJL animations that fit each seperate requirment

A WebGL project capturing the unchanging spark of a ballerina through time.

## ballerina is hierarchical object

hierarchical object of at least three levels in the hierarchy  (e.g. human arm body -> shoulder -> elbow ...) where joint motion clearly shows the interaction between levels. A good example of this is the legs in A1, note that legs in A2 will not count (you can not simply use the legs to fulfill this requirement)

## 60-degree camera fly around

think I am done?
